Electron allows us to integrate with the operating system to trigger the file browser to navigate to the location of a given file or to open a file path in the default application for that file type.

shell is available for main and renderers

shell.showItemInFolder(path)
shell.openItem(path)

you get context menus with different items and different available positions by dynamically generating them from functions before showing them

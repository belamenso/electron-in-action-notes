Tray module
    like a peer to BrowserWindow

declare important things (like main windows, trays) in the global scope to prevent it from being garbage collected

you can make global shortcuts (globalShortcut module)

notification API

!! trick:
you can make a new browserWindow that is never shown, and have some code there, that is running in the background (e.g. for displaying notifications or computing something)
